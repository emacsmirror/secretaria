  `org-agenda-file`, `org-agenda-appt` kicks in and updates.

  I'm working on getting tasks forgotten by the user, i.e.: re-scheduled
  by org-mode or with due deadlines. Hopefully someone more experienced
  answer my question http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/27579/690
- Merge branch 'feature/custom-html-export' [Jorge Araya Navarro]

  Useful later when Secretaria.el is checking your TO-DOs and stuff like
  that, and if your Emacs session crashed, she will remind you you were
  doing a task at that moment.

----------------
